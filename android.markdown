## Updates
When new versions are released to the KnowU app you will be able to update the app via Google Play. Similar way when you installed the app in the first place. Note that the application name might show as *app.mxm.knowu (unreviewed)* instead of just KnowU. You can also just navigate directly here [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.mxm.knowu&hl=en-US&ah=AiHcSzx6-s7YxPO-9JYLhIVHYDE](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.mxm.knowu&hl=en-US&ah=AiHcSzx6-s7YxPO-9JYLhIVHYDE) to update the app.
