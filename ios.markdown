## 1st step
Get an invitation from KnowU, send your details via [this form](https://knowu.app/join/). After you have received confirmation via email that you provided in the form proceed to step 2.

## 2nd step
You need to install TestFligh application on your phone from [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/testflight/id899247664). This is normal process and pre-requirement for apps that have not yet been publicly published on App Store.
